# variable initialization and type reflection in go


This example demonstrates the use of **variable initialization and type reflection in go
** in Go.

## Concepts Covered

- short variable declaration
- multiple variable initialization
- formatted output with fmt.Printf
- type reflection using %T verb
- value printing using %v verb


## Purpose

To illustrate how to declare and initialize variables of different types simultaneously and display their values alongside their respective types using formatted printing.


## Notes

- The short variable declaration syntax (:=) infers variable types automatically.
- Using %T in fmt.Printf reveals the dynamic type of the variable at runtime.
- %v provides a default format for printing values regardless of type.
- Combining multiple declarations in one statement improves code conciseness and readability.
