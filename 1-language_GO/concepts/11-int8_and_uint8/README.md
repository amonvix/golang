# Signed and Unsigned 8-bit Integers in Go

This example demonstrates the use of **Signed and Unsigned 8-bit Integers in Go
** in Go.

## Concepts Covered

- int8 data type
- uint8 data type
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Printing variable values and types using fmt.Printf
- Format verbs %v and %T in Go

## Purpose

To output the values and corresponding data types of signed and unsigned 8-bit integer variables, demonstrating the difference in their range and type representation in Go.

## Notes

- int8 supports values from -128 to 127, while uint8 supports values from 0 to 255.
- Using %v prints the value in a default format, and %T prints the variable's type.
- Declaring variables with explicit types ensures clarity in integer size and sign./home/amonvix/projetos/golang/language_GO/concepts/11-int8_and_uint8
- The maximum values for int8 and uint8 are assigned to demonstrate the upper bounds of these types.
