# usage of external package functions in main


This example demonstrates the use of **usage of external package functions in main
** in Go.

## Concepts Covered

- importing and using third-party packages
- function calls and return value handling
- printing output to standard output
- variable assignment for function results
- direct function call within print statements


## Purpose

To illustrate invoking multiple functions from an external package and outputting their returned string values, demonstrating both storing results in variables and direct printing.


## Notes

- Avoid unnecessary intermediate variables when immediate printing suffices.
- Ensure the external package is properly installed and available in the module path.
- Consistent naming conventions improve readability when handling multiple similar function calls.
- Side-effect functions without return values can be called directly without assignment.
