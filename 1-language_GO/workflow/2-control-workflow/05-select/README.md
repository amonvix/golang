# Select Statement

This example demonstrates the use of the `select` statement in Go.

## Concepts Covered

- Channel communication
- Blocking vs non-blocking operations
- `select` with multiple channels
- `default` case behavior

## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to understand:

- How Go handles concurrent communication
- How `select` differs from `switch`
- When `select` is appropriate in real applications

## Notes

The `select` statement is used exclusively for channel operations and is central to Go’s concurrency model.
