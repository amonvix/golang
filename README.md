# Go (Golang) — ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Go-blue) Learnig path with hands-on

This repository contains hands-on exercises and structured examples developed while studying the Go (Golang) programming language.

The focus is on **idiomatic Go**, **clear control flow**, **concurrency**, **testing**, and **engineering fundamentals**, following a progressive, university-level curriculum.
