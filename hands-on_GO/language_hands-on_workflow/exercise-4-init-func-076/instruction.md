## 🎯 Objective

Enhance the previous Go program by applying conditional logic and proper initialization using Go’s built-in mechanisms.

---

## 🔀 Conditional Logic Update

Modify the previous program to use **one** of the following conditional logic statements:

- `switch` statement
- `select` statement

### ❓ Decision & Rationale

**Chosen statement:** `switch`

**Why?**

- Cleaner and more readable than chained `if/else`
- Ideal for evaluating a single variable against multiple cases
- Improves maintainability and clarity

## ⚙️ Initialization with `init()`

Update the program so it uses the `init` function to print the following message:

```text
This is where initialization for my program occurs
```
