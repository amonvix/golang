## 🔀 Conditional Logic Update

The previous program was modified to use **one** of the following switch or select:

- `switch` statement
- `select` statement

### ✅ Chosen Statement

**`switch`**

### 🤔 Why?

The `switch` statement was chosen because it provides clearer and more readable control flow when evaluating a single value against multiple conditions. It avoids deeply nested `if/else` blocks and is easier to maintain.
