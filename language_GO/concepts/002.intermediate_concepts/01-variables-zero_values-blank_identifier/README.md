# Go Variable, zero value and blank identifier

This explanation covers the usage and the difference between then, including:

- Variables normally already have a value declared or is waiting to receive the value, as soon as the variable is declared
- Zero values is a valid value, since the number zero take space in the memory of the computer or app
- Blank Identifier is used when you receive a value to store, but the program don't need it for nothing, so you can omit the value, just ignoring it

Here is the first explanation created by me, using what I could learn from the course.
All the README.md will follow the same information. What is the code for, how to used it and where.
