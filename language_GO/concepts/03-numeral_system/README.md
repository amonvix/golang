# Numeral System and Numeric Types in Go

This example demonstrates the use of numeric literals and numeric types in Go, showing how the same mathematical value can be represented with different types and precisions.

## Concepts Covered

- Numeric literals
- Type inference
- Integer and floating-point types
- Explicit type declaration
- Floating-point precision
- Runtime type inspection using format specifiers

## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to understand:

- How Go infers types from numeric literals
- How integer and floating-point values differ
- How numeric precision affects stored values
- How to inspect both value and type at runtime

## Notes

This example is intentionally small and focused to highlight how Go handles numeric values, types, and precision without unnecessary complexity.

It demonstrates that numeric literals define not only a value, but also a type, and that explicit type conversion is required when higher precision or a different numeric representation is needed.
