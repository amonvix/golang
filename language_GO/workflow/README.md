# Workflow & Program Execution

This section focuses on **how Go programs execute and make decisions**.

Topics include:

- Control flow
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Execution paths
- Program structure

The goal is to understand not just _what_ Go does, but _how and why_ it executes code the way it does.
